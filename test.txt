Based on the screenshots provided, you are introducing two significant improvements: automated verification for the `external-dns` application in non-prod environments, and a quality-of-life feature in ArgoCD to manually restart failed Jobs.

Here is a drafted PR description you can use.

**PR Title:** feat: Add external-dns verification job and ArgoCD Job restart action

### 📝 Summary

This PR introduces a PostSync verification workflow for `external-dns` in `dev` and `stg` environments and adds a global custom action to ArgoCD to allow manual restarting of Kubernetes Jobs via the UI.

### 🛠️ Changes

#### 1. ArgoCD Custom Action (Lua Script)

* **File:** `bootstrap/shared/patches/argocd-cm.yaml` (Inferred context)
* **Feature:** Added a `restart` action for `batch/Job` resources in ArgoCD.
* **Logic:**
* The action is available only if the Job has the label `argocd.custom-action/retryable: "true"`.
* Because Jobs are immutable, the Lua script performs a "Deep Copy" of the failed job, cleanses specific fields (selectors, `controller-uid`, timestamps, and `resourceVersion`), and creates a **new** Job with a unique suffix (e.g., `-retry-<timestamp>`).
* This allows engineers to retry failed PostSync hooks or CronJobs directly from the ArgoCD UI without triggering a full Application Sync or manually deleting the stuck Job.



#### 2. External DNS Verification (`dev`/`stg` only)

* **File:** `apps/baseline/templates/external-dns.yaml`
* **Feature:** Implemented a verification Job that runs after the application sync (`PostSync` hook).
* **Resources Added:**
* **ServiceAccount:** `verification-{{ $app.name }}`
* **ClusterRole & Binding:** Grants `get` and `list` permissions on `pods` and `services` to the verification job.
* **Job:** A container running the image `verification-{{ $app.name }}:0.0.1`.


* **Configuration:**
* Wrapped in a conditional block: `{{- if has $.Values.mox.cluster.env (list "dev" "stg") }}`.
* Annotated with `argocd.custom-action/retryable: "true"` to utilize the new restart feature mentioned above.



### 🎯 Objective

* Ensure `external-dns` deployments are automatically verified in lower environments.
* Reduce operational toil by allowing one-click retries for transient failures in verification jobs or other hook-based tasks.

### 🧪 Testing

* Verified that the `verification` resources are only generated when `env` is `dev` or `stg`.
* Verified that the "Restart" button appears in the ArgoCD UI for jobs with the `retryable` label.
* Confirmed that clicking "Restart" successfully creates a new Job pod and retains the necessary spec configurations.

### 💡 Optional Note for you (Andy):

In Image 1, line 166 (inside the verification job env vars), you have:

```yaml
- name: TEST_NAMESPACE
  value: verification-{{ $app.name }}

```

Usually, `TEST_NAMESPACE` implies the namespace where the tests *run* or the namespace being *tested*. Currently, it looks like you are setting it to the **Job Name** (`verification-...`) rather than the Namespace (`{{ $app.namespace.name }}`).

If this is a typo, you might want to fix it before pushing!
