**Objective**
Develop the automated verification logic for the baseline app based on the approved Design Doc. The goal is to move beyond replace the manual verification and implement a an automated test that runs after every deployment.

**Scope of Work**

1. **Script Implementation:** Write the verification code (Python/Bash/Go) that executes the "Test Scenario" defined in the Design Doc.
2. **Safety & Cleanup:** Implement the "Pre-flight Cleanup" and "Graceful Shutdown" logic to ensure the script is self-cleaning and does not leave test data in the cluster.
3. **Containerization:** Build and publish the docker image for the verification script.
4. **Integration:** Configure the Kubernetes Job manifest to run as an **ArgoCD PostSync/PreSync Hook** if possible.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* [ ] **Logic Implemented:** The script successfully performs the *functional* create/trigger/assert workflow defined in the Design Doc.
* [ ] **Safety Mechanisms:** The script handles failures gracefully and cleans up test resources (preventing "zombie" resources).
* [ ] **ArgoCD Integration:** The Job triggers automatically after a Sync and accurately reports status back to ArgoCD (Green = Functionally Working, Red = Functional Failure).
* [ ] **Timeout Handling:** The Job has a configured `activeDeadlineSeconds` to prevent hanging indefinitely.
* [ ] **README Finalized:** The Design Doc (README.md) created in the spike is updated with final usage instructions and configuration details.
* [ ] **Code Review:** Code passed PR review.
