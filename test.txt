Here is a clean, simplified **Kubernetes RBAC** section for your README.

Instead of pasting large blocks of YAML, this table summarizes *what* the script creates and *why* it needs those permissions. It highlights the security model (bootstrapping) we discussed.

## 🔐 Kubernetes RBAC

This tool operates on a **Least Privilege** model. It does not run with admin privileges. Instead, it uses a "Bootstrapper" pattern: the job starts with just enough permission to create a sandbox, then grants itself testing rules *only* within that sandbox.

### Required Permissions

The `ServiceAccount` running this job requires the following rules:

| Scope | Resources | Verbs | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discovery** | `pods` | `get`, `list` | To find the running `external-dns` pod and inspect its CLI arguments. |
| **Lifecycle** | `namespaces` | `create`, `delete`, `get` | To create and destroy the ephemeral `verification-external-dns-...` namespace. |
| **Security** | `clusterroles` | `bind` | To bind the **Test Rules** (see below) to the ephemeral namespace. |
| **Security** | `rolebindings` | `create` | To create the binding inside the ephemeral namespace. |

### Test Rules (Ephemeral)

Once the temporary namespace is created, the script binds a restricted ClusterRole (`verification-rules`) that allows creating test resources. These permissions are **strictly scoped** to the temporary namespace:

* **Services:** `create`, `delete`
* **Ingresses:** `create`, `delete`
* **Istio Gateways:** `create`, `delete`

> **Note:** The script cannot create or delete resources in any other namespace (e.g., `default`, `kube-system`).
