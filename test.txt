### PR Title Options

* `feat: Refactor verification RBAC and inject DNS context variables`
* `fix: Update verification job permissions and add environment configuration`

### PR Description

**Summary**
This PR refactors the verification job to use the main application ServiceAccount instead of a dedicated verification SA, streamlines the RBAC permissions required for the integration tests, and injects new environment variables needed for the `external-dns` version check and Route53 zone validation.

**Key Changes**

**1. RBAC & ServiceAccount Refactor**

* **Removed:** Deleted the dedicated `ServiceAccount` (`verification-{{ $app.name }}`).
* **Updated:** Configured the verification Job to use the existing application ServiceAccount (`{{ $app.name }}`) via `serviceAccountName`.
* **Permissions:** Updated the `Role` and `RoleBinding` to grant the ServiceAccount permissions to:
* `create` and `delete` **Deployments** (apps/v1).
* `create` and `delete` **Gateways** (networking.istio.io).
* `get` and `list` **Pods**.



**2. Job Configuration & Environment Variables**

* Added the following environment variables to the verification container to support the Python automation script:
* `EXTERNAL_DNS_EXPECTED_VERSION`: Dynamically constructed from values (allows version matching).
* `ENV`: Passes the cluster environment context.
* `TEST_IMAGE`: Defines the alpine-k8s image used for testing.
* `HOSTED_ZONE_NAME`: Implements logic to dynamically select the correct Route53 DNS zone based on the cluster region.



**Reasoning**

* Consolidating the ServiceAccount simplifies the chart and reduces the number of resources managed.
* The added RBAC permissions (Deployments/Gateways) are required for the verification script to spin up test resources to validate DNS record creation.
* The `HOSTED_ZONE_NAME` and `EXPECTED_VERSION` are critical for the script to validate against the correct AWS Route53 zone and ensure the deployed `external-dns` matches the target version.
