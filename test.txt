📝 Summary
This PR introduces the initial foundation for an automated Istio release verification suite. The goal is to replace manual validation steps with a robust Python script that ensures the Istio control plane is healthy and configurations are valid before proceeding with functional testing.

This is Part 1 of the verification series, focusing on:

Infrastructure (Helper functions, command execution).

Smart YAML Templating (Handling both Standard and Envoy/Lua templates).

Control Plane Health Checks.

Configuration Analysis.

🛠 Key Changes
1. Robust Templating Engine (apply_yaml_template)
Implemented a flexible templating function to handle a specific edge case with EnvoyFilters containing Lua scripts.

Standard Mode: Uses Python’s .format() for standard YAML injection (e.g., VirtualServices).

Safe Mode (use_safe_template=True): Uses string.Template ($VAR syntax) for files containing Lua code or complex block strings. This prevents conflicts between Python's {} placeholders and Lua's function syntax function() { ... }.

Dynamic Arguments: Utilizes **kwargs to allow passing dynamic variables to templates without modifying the function signature.

2. Control Plane Validation (check_control_plane)
Verifies istiod deployment availability based on the ISTIO_VERSION environment variable.

Checks proxy synchronization status (istioctl proxy-status), ensuring no proxies remain in a STALE state.

3. Configuration Analysis (check_istio_configurations)
Wraps istioctl analyze to detect potential configuration issues across all namespaces (suppressing standard noise).

4. Utilities
Added a run_command wrapper with structured logging (stdout/stderr) and error handling.

🔜 Future Work (Part 2 & 3)
Subsequent PRs will build upon this foundation to add:

Data Plane Verification: Deploying sample apps (Client/Target).

Traffic Testing: Verifying connectivity, retries, and timeouts.

Gateway Verification: Ingress/Egress checks.
