Getting `ruff` set up on a Mac is a great move—it’s incredibly fast and replaces multiple tools like Flake8, isort, and Black in one go.

Here is a clean, "Quick Start" workflow you can drop directly into your README.

## ⚡ Using Ruff Locally (macOS)

Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. Use this guide to get up and running on your MacBook.

### 1\. Installation

The easiest way to install Ruff on macOS is via **Homebrew** (system-wide) or **pip** (project-specific).

  * **Using Homebrew (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    brew install ruff
    ```
  * **Using pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install ruff
    ```

### 2\. Basic Workflow

Ruff handles both **linting** (finding errors/smells) and **formatting** (styling code).

| Action | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Check** | `ruff check .` | Lint the current directory for errors. |
| **Fix** | `ruff check --fix .` | Automatically fix linting errors (like unused imports). |
| **Format** | `ruff format .` | Reformat code (Black-compatible style). |
| **Watch** | `ruff check --watch .` | Run Ruff in the background as you save files. |

### 3\. Editor Integration (VS Code)

To get the most out of Ruff, you should see errors in real-time within your editor.

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Install the **Ruff extension** from the Marketplace.
3.  (Optional) Enable "Format on Save" in your settings:
      * `"editor.formatOnSave": true`
      * `"editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"`

### 4\. Configuration

While Ruff works out of the box, you can customize rules in a `pyproject.toml` file at the root of your project:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Line length similar to Black
line-length = 88

[tool.ruff.lint]
# Enable Pyflakes (F) and check for common bug (E) codes
select = ["E", "F", "I"] 
# I = isort (import sorting)
```

Would you like me to help you write a **pre-commit hook** configuration so Ruff runs automatically before every git commit?
