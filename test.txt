This PR establishes the Kubernetes infrastructure required to automate Istio release verification. It introduces a CronJob, a ConfigMap containing test fixtures, and the necessary RBAC permissions to allow the test runner to manage ephemeral environments.

This change enables the platform to run automated verification suites (e.g., post-upgrade or on a schedule) by providing the necessary runtime environment and access controls.

🛠 Infrastructure Changes
1. CronJob (release-verification-istio)
Purpose: Acts as the runner for the verification suite.

Schedule: Configured to run @monthly, but set to suspend: true by default to allow for controlled, manual triggering or pipeline-based execution.

Configuration: Mounts the test manifests from the ConfigMap into the container at /etc/istio-verify-config.

2. ConfigMap (release-verification-istio-cm)
Stores the Kubernetes manifests used by the test runner to spin up temporary workloads. The data includes:

test-apps.yaml: Templates for the Target Service, Deployment, and Client Sidecar pod.

no-sidecar-verify-client.yaml: Template for the negative-test client (explicitly configured with sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false").

3. RBAC Permissions (ClusterRole & Binding)
The test runner requires elevated permissions to manage the lifecycle of ephemeral test environments.

ServiceAccount: Binds the CronJob to a dedicated identity.

ClusterRole Permissions: Grants create, get, list, watch, delete, and patch verbs on:

namespaces (to create/destroy test-ns-xxx)

pods, deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, serviceaccounts (to deploy test apps within the ephemeral namespace).
